        <p>There are four different images of mochi presented. The first mochi image is a "gif", which are good for animations. The second mochi image is a "jpg", which are good for photos. The third mochi image is a "png", which are good for diagrams and icons. Finally, the fourth mochi image is a "svg", which are great because they will render pixel-perfect at any resolution. </p>
